        <h1>Saint the Coder</h1>
        <p>
            I've loved computers and technology ever since I was a kid, 
            I was first introduced to computers with a game called 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q*bert">qbert</a>. It was old when I played it the first time but it 
            was really fun and seem to have been lost to time. I am currently a student
            at Harrisburg University of science and technology for computer science. I chose
            this major because software enginneering ever since I was introduced to the concept
            has enamored me and I like to learn about it. Data structures, algorithms, how
            your mind has to think completely different when trying to understand these concepts.
            I liked building software that I think is useful and even understand gaming on a 
            different level than before which is awesome to me since gaming is my favorite hobby.
            The way I want to use the skills I acquired is to help people who are in the same 
            situation I was in, I was born in a first world country but it seems like learning
            about tech is extremely segregated. I never touched a computer in school until 
            high school and only 4 times maybe, despite being hyper interested in them. My 
            goal would be to get kids access not only to computers but also access to knowledge
            about computers, like how to build a computer, all the parts of a computer, or even
            learning how to code, whatever they may be interested in, I want them to have that
            opportunity.
